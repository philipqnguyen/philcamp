# Lesson 1

## Git and Github

### Step 1
Initialize a new git repository called `fizzbuzz`. We will use this repository to store this workk. You can read more about basic git operations here: https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/init.html

### Step 2
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 using `console.log`. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

Please ensure that the functions are encapsulated as methods of a class. Such that:

```
const fizzBuzz = new FizzBuzz();
fizzBuzz.print

// console output
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
```

### Step 3

Now `git add .` your code and `git commit` your code. Push it into a github repository called `fizzbuzz`. If you do not have a github account, create one.
