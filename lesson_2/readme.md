# Lesson 2

## FizzBuzz Advance

### Step 1
In your previous `fizzbuzz` repository. Modify your fizzbuzz code so that `fizzbuzz.print()` would accept a max `Number` as an argument. For example, `fizzbuzz.print(500)` would print numbers from 1 to 500. Same as before, multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

### Step 2

After you complete, `git add` and `git commit` your code. Push it back up to your github repository.
